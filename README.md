# Malum-Thaumic-Rejects

This is a small personal project that will, hopefully, turn into something a bit more fleshed out.

# A Thaumaturge, cast out of his school of magick for his belief that there is more to be done. More to accomplish. More to take control of.

The idea is pretty simple; What if the Encyclopedia Arcana, within the Malum Mod, was written by a scourned thaumaturge. A man who has been driven to follow his own path along the arcane arts by the weakness and overly-gentle nature he percieves within the Thaumaturgic practices?
